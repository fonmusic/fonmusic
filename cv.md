I also have a keen interest in exploring new software and technologies. I have a broad range of interests beyond programming, and I believe that the best solutions and innovations arise at the intersection of different fields. In my hobbies, I deeply study architecture and history. I also have extensive experience in music, including both creation and rights management.
